# The Witch's Book
### A Design Document
#### Working Title - TBD

---

## Logline

A lonely witch on an empty planet writes worlds into existence, learning through creation that witnessing life *is* living, and that the question of "why am I here" matters less than the miracle of being here at all.

---

## Core Experience

**Genre:** Idle/incremental civilization builder with narrative progression
**Aesthetic:** 2003 browser game meets illustrated manuscript - text-heavy, minimally animated, pixel-art-adjacent (Midjourney + Procreate + Affinity pipeline)
**Tone:** Cozy melancholy. Studio Ghibli loneliness. The ache is real but so is the wonder.

**The Player Is:** Brianna, the Witch. But also themselves, watching her watch. The parallel is intentional.

**The Core Loop:**
1. Open the Book
2. Write conditions into being (the Web - poetic, abstract)
3. Watch life emerge (the World - literal, abundant)
4. Observe, study, know, intervene
5. Discover synergies and milestones
6. Eventually, close the Book (prestige)
7. Carry forward what you've learned
8. Return to a slightly less empty planet

---

## The Two Games

The experience splits into two phenomenologically distinct modes:

### The Web (Author Mode)

Where Brianna writes conditions. Poetic, abstract, combinatorial.

- **Feeling:** Massive through *implication*
- **Interaction:** Choose conditions that enable emergence
- **Visuals:** Sparse, symbolic, node-based
- **Time:** Deliberate, weighty choices

She doesn't create organisms. She writes "let there be something that reaches toward light" and the world figures out photosynthesis, eyes, sunflowers, ambition.

### The World (Witness Mode)

Where Brianna watches what emerges. Literal, granular, abundant.

- **Feeling:** Massive through *stuff*
- **Interaction:** Observe, study, intervene, tend
- **Visuals:** Dense, varied, dozens of specific things
- **Time:** Idle, numbers tick up, clicker satisfaction

She wrote one condition. The world gave her forty flowers. Each with a name, a behavior, synergies to discover.

---

## The Witch: Brianna

### Who She Is

She doesn't know why she's here. She doesn't know if she was exiled, created, forgotten, or if she simply *is*. Her planet is empty. She has a Book that lets her write worlds into existence.

She is:
- **Ariel** (1989) - longing for a world she can see but not touch, collecting fragments of lives she can't quite live
- **Pink Diamond** - immense power, immense isolation, loving so much without understanding how to be loved
- **Entrapta** - finding connection through curiosity, loving people as fascinating systems, not always recognizing herself as one of them

She loves people *so much*. She doesn't really understand that she is one.

### Character Arc (Across Full Game)

**Early game:** Wonder and loneliness. She's excited to create, but there's an ache. Why is she alone? Why does she exist? What's the point?

**Mid game:** Frustration and searching. Some worlds fail. Some dead-ends repeat. She's looking for answers in her creations - maybe if she makes the *right* world, she'll understand.

**Late game:** Acceptance without resignation. The golden ending isn't "she finds the answer." It's "she realizes the question was never the point." Her life is beautiful because it's life. Being able to wonder is enough. Being able to love, even from a distance, even as a witness - that's enough.

**The Golden Ending:** She looks at her planet - no longer empty, touched by the essence of everything she's created - and she realizes she's not alone. Not because someone came, but because she was never really separate from what she made. The loneliness was real, and it also wasn't the whole truth.

### Titles (Unlockable)

Titles are earned through creation milestones and reflect her evolving relationship with what she makes:

| Title | Unlock Condition | Notes |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| The Witch | Default | What she calls herself when she doesn't know what else to be |
| The Dreamer | First world created | She imagines before she writes |
| The Gardener | First plant life | Tending, not just making |
| The Mother | First sapient life | Creation that can look back at her |
| The Witness | Golden ending | What she always was |
| ??? | ??? | Room for more |

---

## The Web: Conditions and Emergence

### Philosophy

The tech tree is a **web**, not a tree. Everything connects to everything. There's no trunk, no optimal path - just threads she follows based on curiosity and desire.

**Nodes are conditions**, not creatures. She writes constraints; life emerges from them.

**Connections are emergences**. When conditions combine, new possibilities appear.

**She is the center** - but she doesn't know it yet. The web appears centerless until she's traced enough connections to see the true topology. The golden ending, visualized.

### Dimensionality

The web isn't flat. It never was. She just couldn't see the depth yet.

**Early game:** A 2D constellation. Simple. Manageable. She learns.

**Mid game:** Some nodes appear on different planes - slightly offset, visible but unreachable from her current world. "Oh. There are other possibility spaces."

**Late game:** She can rotate the web, see the layers, understand that each world was a *path through* possibility space, not the whole thing. And the axis everything rotates around... is her.

The planes aren't prescriptive entities - they're descriptive. A way for her (and the player) to perceive divergence. The web is the territory. The planes are the map.

### Tier Structure

```
TIER 0 (Hidden) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
   The Unspoken Assumptions
   ~15-20 nodes, invisible at start
   Unlocking one = late-game reward, changes everything
   
TIER 1 (Foundational Conditions) ────────────────────────────
   The First Choices
   ~8-12 nodes, visible from early game
   Poetic, abstract: "Let there be flow"
   
TIER 2 (Emergent Conditions) ────────────────────────────────
   What Emerges From Combination
   ~30-50 nodes, appear as Tier 1 combines
   More specific: "metabolism," "structure," "gradient"
   
TIER 3 (Emergent Phenomena) ─────────────────────────────────
   Starting to Feel Like Things
   ~100+ nodes, appear as Tier 2 combines
   Named phenomena: "light hunger," "boundary maintenance"
   
TIER 4 (Observable Life) ────────────────────────────────────
   The Stuff in the World
   Categories of life, visually represented
   Assets live here, but templated/generated for abundance
   
TIER 5 (Discovery Pages) ────────────────────────────────────
   The Ladybug Moments
   Specific emergences get illustrated pages
   Rare. Special. Worth celebrating.
```

### Tier 0: The Hidden Assumptions

She doesn't choose these. They're just... true. For now.

**Temporal:**
- Time has direction
- Things can end (death exists)
- Change is continuous

**Spatial/Physical:**
- Separation exists (this is not that)
- Three spatial dimensions
- Locality matters (here is not there)
- Gravity pulls toward mass

**Biochemical:**
- Water is the solvent
- Carbon is the backbone
- Energy comes from a star
- Chirality is fixed (molecular handedness)
- Information storage is chemical (DNA/RNA)

**Logical/Relational:**
- Cause precedes effect
- Identity persists
- Scarcity exists
- Information can be lost

First prestige reward: seeing that these *were* assumptions. The web shifts. She goes "oh. *Oh.*"

### Tier 1: The First Choices

Where she actually starts. These feel like "the basics" but are already narrowing possibility space.

| Condition | What it enables |
|-----------|-----------------|
| "Let there be flow" | Cycles, currents, exchange |
| "Let there be holding" | Containment, accumulation, memory |
| "Let there be falling" | Gravity, gradients, tendency toward |
| "Let there be reaching" | Growth, extension, hunger |
| "Let there be returning" | Cycles, decay, nutrients back to source |
| "Let there be boundary" | Self/other, membranes, surfaces |
| "Let there be change when touched" | Reactivity, sensitivity, response |
| "Let there be repeating" | Patterns, reproduction, rhythm |

### Tier 2: Emergent Conditions

Combinations of Tier 1 produce these:

| Combination | Emergence |
|-------------|-----------|
| Flow + Holding | Metabolism, pools, deposits |
| Flow + Reaching | Dispersal, currents that carry |
| Holding + Reaching | Growth, roots, structure |
| Reaching + Returning | Life cycle, reproduction |
| Returning + Flow | Nutrient cycling, weather |
| Boundary + Change | Nerves, reflexes, sensation |
| Repeating + Reaching | Evolution, iteration toward |

And so on. The combinatorial explosion begins.

### The Ladybug Principle

The web isn't about optimal paths. If she *really wants* ladybugs, she can hack toward them without building a balanced ecosystem. Her worlds can be weird and specific. She's an author with preferences.

In a web (vs. a tree), taking a weird path isn't cheating. It's just *a* path. Authorship, not optimization.

---

## The World: Observation and Intervention

### The Observation Loop

**Familiarity builds meaningful power - the power to enact change kindly.**

She can't intervene until she's witnessed. Observation is the first action. Attention is currency.

| Stage | What She Does | What She Gains |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **Notice** | Thing appears in the world | Name shows, greyed out |
| **Observe** | Click/focus, watch it exist | Description fills in, behaviors revealed |
| **Study** | Sustained attention over time | Metrics visible, patterns emerge |
| **Know** | Threshold reached | Intervention options unlock |

A new algae bloom appears. At first: "something green in the shallows." She clicks, watches. Learns it pulses with the light cycle. Learns it spreads toward nutrients. Learns it dies when water warms. *Then* she can intervene. Because now she knows what "help" would mean.

This prevents mindless optimization. You can't improve what you don't understand.

### Intervention Verbs

Different domains, different verbs. The language of care varies.

| Domain | Verb | Feeling |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Plant life** | Tend | Gardener, patient, nurturing |
| **Animal life** | Guide | Shepherd, gentle direction |
| **Ecosystems** | Encourage | Soft correction, trust in balance |
| **Geology/Water** | Shape | Sculptor, slow, monumental |
| **Weather/Atmosphere** | Invoke | Petitioner, requesting not commanding |
| **Social/Ritual** | Witness | Sacred presence, non-interference |

That last one is key. When life becomes complex enough to have *culture*, her role shifts. She can't Tend a funeral. She can't Encourage a religion. She can only Witness.

**The more complex her creation becomes, the less she can intervene.** Which is exactly how parenthood works. How authorship works. How love works.

### Intervention Tiers

| Tier | Name | Feeling | Cost |
|------|------|---------|------|
| **Passive** | Witness | Spirits attend. Presence helps. | Low |
| **Active** | Encourage | A push. Temporary boost. | Medium (Insight) |
| **Miraculous** | Grant | Permanent change. New capability. | High (Essence + Insight) |

The spirits are her hands, but hands can hold gently or grasp or offer.

## Resources

### Meta Resources (Carried Between Worlds)

| Resource | What It Is | Gained From | Spent On |
|----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Essence** | Raw creative/magical power | Milestones, prestige, world completion | Unlocking conditions in the Web, major Grants |
| **Knowing** | Accumulated understanding | All observation across all worlds | Permanent shortcuts, hidden node reveals |

### World Resources (Reset on Prestige)

| Resource | What It Is | Gained From | Spent On |
|----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Insight** | Understanding of *this* world's things | Observation, study, time watching | Interventions, unlocking deeper knowledge |
| **Favor** | Relationship with *this* world | Kind interventions, balance, patience | Miracle access, synergy reveals, preventing collapse |

### World Metrics (Health Indicators)

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| **Nutrients** | Cycling organic matter, soil quality |
| **Oxygen** | Atmospheric breathability |
| **Stability** | Ecosystem resilience |
| **Complexity** | Interconnection density |

---

## Favor: The Relationship Meter

Not morality. Relationship. The world responds to how she treats it.

Like Undertale's routes - you *can* strip-mine a world for essence. You'll get the resources. But the world will know.

### High Favor

- Miracles are cheaper
- Hidden synergies reveal themselves
- Negative events are rare
- "Golden" variants of things unlock
- The world *wants* to show her things

### Low Favor

- The world becomes brittle
- Information hides
- Collapse spirals happen
- Gentle interventions lock out
- She gets what she demanded, not what she might have been given

### Favor and Achievements

**High-Favor Path:**

| Achievement | Condition |
|-------------|-----------|
| *First, Do No Harm* | Complete World 1 with no forced interventions |
| *The Long Garden* | Maintain balance for [time] without correction |
| *Invited, Not Demanded* | Unlock sapient life without using Grant on fauna |
| *The World Showed Me* | Discover a synergy through pure observation |

**Low-Favor Path:**

| Achievement | Condition |
|-------------|-----------|
| *What It Cost* | Complete a world with Favor below threshold |
| *The Forced Bloom* | Use Grant 10 times in one world |
| *They Feared Me* | Reach sapient life with low Favor (unique first-contact: temples of appeasement) |

### The Journal

Brianna keeps a journal. Entries generate based on her actions and Favor.

**High Favor, late game:**
> *They buried their dead today. I didn't know they would do that. I didn't write it. It just... happened. I watched. I don't know why I'm crying.*

**Low Favor, late game:**
> *They buried their dead today. They looked up, after. Toward me? No. Toward something they imagine. Something that takes. I should feel proud. I made them. Why do I feel so far away?*

---

## The Spirits

Small, soft, round creatures - think Chao from Sonic Adventure. Manifestations of Brianna's will. Her hands in the world.

**Visual design:** Simple silhouettes, 2-3 colors max, expressive despite minimal features. Cute but not cloying.

**Function:**
- Execute her interventions
- The thing the player watches when idling
- Their movement/mood reflects world state and Favor

**They are not:**
- The population of the world
- Characters with arcs
- Replacements for real connection

---

## World 1: The First Creation

### Starting Conditions

- Single continuous landmass
- Saline sea surrounding
- Limited essence (constrains how many Tier 1 conditions she can afford)
- All Tier 0 assumptions in place (she doesn't know they're assumptions)

Before she writes anything:
- Rock (barren landmass)
- Salt water (empty sea)
- Sky (atmosphere, no weather)
- Light (a sun, or something like it)
- One spirit (or a small group), waiting

### First Choices

She has essence for ~4-6 Tier 1 conditions. Likely first picks:

1. "Let there be flow" → water cycle, currents
2. "Let there be holding" → minerals concentrate, memory
3. "Let there be reaching" → growth, hunger
4. "Let there be returning" → decay, nutrients cycle

### What Emerges (World 1 Content)

**Aquatic:**
- Salt deposits (crystalline formations, base mineral)
- Thermoclines (temperature layers, niche diversity)
- Algae bloom (first photosynthesizers)
- Tidal pools (biodiversity hotspots)
- Kelp-like fronds (structure, habitat)
- Filter feeders (sessile, water cleaning)
- Crawling grazers (early mobile life)
- Soft-bodied swimmers (jellyfish-ish)

**Terrestrial:**
- Mineral veins (various types)
- Lichens (first land colonizers)
- Moss carpets (moisture retention)
- Fungal networks (underground connection)
- Ferns (first real reaching)
- Liverworts (ground cover)
- Soil layers (developing slowly)
- Springs (freshwater emergence)

**Atmospheric:**
- Clouds (water cycle visible)
- Rain (freshwater distribution)
- Mist (coastal microhabitats)
- Wind patterns (dispersal later)

### What She Doesn't Have Yet

- Flowers (no pollinators yet)
- Insects (needs more terrestrial complexity)
- Vertebrates (needs food chain depth)
- Weather beyond rain
- Predators (only filter feeders and grazers)

These become goals. "I want flowers" drives her toward the conditions that enable them.

### World 1 Asset Strategy

Abundance through combination, not enumeration:

| Category | Base Assets | Variations | Perceived Total |
|----------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Flowers | 8-10 | Color, size, petal count, glow | 40-60 |
| Trees | 5-6 | Leaf shape, height, fruit | 20-30 |
| Fungi | 4-5 | Cap, color, cluster size | 15-25 |
| Mosses | 3-4 | Color, density | 10-15 |
| Minerals | 6-8 | Color, vein pattern | 20-30 |
| Water life | 5-6 | Size, color, movement | 20-30 |
| Insects | 5-6 | Color, wing, size | 25-35 |

Naming: Scientific-ish. She's a scholar of her own creation.

## The Book: Opening and Closing

### Opening the Book

- Transition animation: pages turn, light emerges
- Shift from Study (see Brianna) to World (see through her eyes)
- The world unfolds as an illustrated manuscript that is also alive

### Discoveries

When something new emerges, it becomes a Discovery page:
- Illustrated (this is where specific art lives)
- Contains her observations, measurements, wonder
- Mechanically: unlocks for future worlds, essence rewards

### Closing the Book (Prestige)

When a world is "done":
- Player decorates the book cover (including PNG stickers)
- Book placed on shelf (visible in study)
- Record of the run preserved
- Meta-progress carries forward

The closed Book is a trophy, a memory, proof that something existed.

---

## Insanity Moments (Narrative Intervention)

When the player gets stuck - repeating choices, hitting dead ends - Brianna notices.

**Manifestations:**
- Journal entries shift tone
- Study visuals change (darker, messier)
- Narration acknowledges the loop
- Gentle nudges toward trying something different
- Eventually: "Maybe this world has taught me what it can."

**Purpose:**
- Loop-breaking as characterization
- The game noticing you (reinforces witnessing theme)
- Teaching prestige timing through narrative
- Making "failure" part of the story

---

## Open Questions

### Prestige Mechanics
- What triggers the *ability* to prestige?
- What triggers the *desire*? How does closing feel good, not like giving up?
- Decorated covers + shelf display helps - completion, not abandonment

### World Endings
- Can a world "fail"? What does collapse look like?
- Can she abandon a Book before it's "done"?
- Difference between finished and closed?

### Spirits
- How aware are they of her?
- Do they ever communicate back?
- Can she lose them?

### Scope for First Release
- First prestige only? Or full arc?
- How many Tier 1/2/3 nodes minimum?
- Is sapient life in v1?

### Title
- "The Witch's Book" is placeholder
- Something about worlds, writing, loneliness, watching, wonder

---

## Influences & Touchstones

**Games:**
- Stardew Valley (Junimos, cozy-melancholy)
- Cookie Clicker / Universal Paperclips (idle mechanics, existential undertones)
- A Dark Room (text-heavy, revelation through discovery)
- Chao Garden (spirit reference)
- Undertale (Favor as relationship, the game remembers)

**Animation/Film:**
- Studio Ghibli (loneliness, wonder)
- Steven Universe (Pink Diamond)
- She-Ra (Entrapta)
- The Little Mermaid (Ariel's longing)

**Philosophy:**
- Deleuze & Guattari (rhizomatic structure, emergence)
- Ecclesiastes (meaningless → meaning through presence)
- Everything Everywhere All at Once (nothing matters → everything matters)
- Witnessing as participation

---

## Development Notes

**Solo dev realities:**
- Scope carefully. First prestige is the MVP.
- Art pipeline: Midjourney → Procreate → Affinity
- Test asset manifest workflow with ~5 assets first
- Build systems that help future-you

**What success looks like:**
- A complete first prestige loop that feels good
- The themes land without being preachy
- Someone plays it and feels seen in their own loneliness
- Brianna feels like a person, not a vehicle
